All of the repositories of this organization are pieces of a single project. We aspire to build a disposible, portable cloud with open-source code that can pass an audit for security using the FedRAMP standard. We do not work for any government. The event cloud can be used by organizations who have similar security aspirations without similar budget to the US Fedral Government. Indeed the very standard Uncle Sam endorses internally is a very nice model for any government, especially one that exists solely on the cloud. 

This is a thought experiment, carried out in code. What would it take to create a cloud for a constitutional convention or a primary election? We have witnessed in passing years the mechanations of physical nations surpressing their citizens by creeping surveillance and blacklisted ips. Our response is a better cloud: a cloud secure enough to host a sovereign state.
